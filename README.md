# adhoc-starter

Starter project optimized for building ad-hoc UI applications.

- ~~Separate frontend and backend.~~ Render everything on the server-side. Embrace [server-driven UI](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-th/radar/techniques/server-driven-ui).

- ~~Separate models, views, controllers.~~ Put all the logic in the endpoint so itâ€™s easier to build and iterate. Views should be generic.

- ~~Develop on dev, deploy to staging and production.~~ [Test safely on production](https://notes.dt.in.th/TestingInProduction) to make feedback loop lowest.

## Prerequisites

You should be somewhat familiar with JavaScript, Bootstrap and Fastify.
